Tekla Model Comparator

The Tekla Model Comparator is an application designed to compare two sets of Tekla models based on member coordinates, allowing a +/-50mm tolerance in the comparison.
The end result is to identify new, deleted and modified members with respect to the assembly position or profile change.

How it works

The comparison process is carried out in three simple steps:

    Read the first set of data: The application reads the data from the first set of Tekla models and stores it in a datatable.

    Read the second set of data: The application reads the data from the second set of Tekla models and stores it in another datatable.

    Compare the data: The application compares the two datatables and generates a report in a data grid. The report is then exported to a .xlsx file.
